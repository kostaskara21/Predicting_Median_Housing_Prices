# Predicting Median Housing Prices in California

## Overview

This project focuses on developing machine learning algorithms to estimate the median housing price in various geographic regions of California. The approach is based on a dataset containing objective characteristics of properties in those regions.

## Dataset

The dataset used is stored in the file housing.csv. It contains information from the 1990 U.S. Census, where each entry corresponds to the smallest geographic unit recorded, representing a population between 600 and 3000 residents.

## Objective

The goal of this assignment was to:

-Explore and preprocess the dataset.

-Develop machine learning models to predict median housing prices.

-Evaluate and compare model performance.

## Technologies Used

-Python

-Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)

-Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
